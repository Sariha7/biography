  <div class="biography-section-wrap">
		<p>I was born and raised in a suburb of Seattle, Washington called Lynnwood.  As the oldest daughter of three girls life was always exciting!  My father was the bread winner, working as a Police Officer and my siblings and I were homeschooled by our mother.  We were involved in many sports, educational co-ops and many other extra-circular activities.  From the age of 4-12 years old I was a competitive gymnast; from 8-17 years old I was a competitive diver.  Sports were one of my favorite pastimes as a child.</p><br>

		<p>In 2009 I enrolled in Ocean Research College Academy, and in 2011 I graduated with my Associates of Arts and Science degree.  From Everett Community College I transferred to the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  In Hawaii I worked as a Resident Assistant for 2.5 years, a Teaching Intern for Cellular and Molecular Biology labs and Introductory Biology labs, as well as taught recitation sections for a Biology course.  In 2014 I graduated with my B.S. in Zoology with a Biochemistry emphasis.  Thoughout various leadership experiences in family, educational, work and residential hall contexts, I learned that I have a great passion for helping other people grow and develop.  After I moved from Hawaii to Charlotte in 2014, it was this passion that motivated me to move from an insurance sales agent role into a leadership role at my current company.  Now, I am working to combine my love of analytics and technology to pioneer new skills in my life and one day help other future programmers learn.
